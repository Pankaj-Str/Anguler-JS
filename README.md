##  To create a new Angular project using the Angular CLI (Command Line Interface), follow these steps:

1. **Install Node.js and npm**:
   Make sure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system. You can download them from the official Node.js website: https://nodejs.org/

2. **Install Angular CLI**:
   Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to install the Angular CLI globally:

   ```bash
   npm install -g @angular/cli
   ```

3. **Create a New Project**:
   Once the Angular CLI is installed, you can create a new Angular project using the following command:

   ```bash
   ng new my-angular-project
   ```

   Replace `my-angular-project` with your desired project name. The CLI will prompt you to answer a few questions about the project setup, such as whether to include Angular routing and which stylesheets to use (CSS, SCSS, etc.). Choose the options that best fit your project's requirements.

4. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   Change your terminal's working directory to the newly created project:

   ```bash
   cd my-angular-project
   ```

5. **Run the Development Server**:
   Launch the development server to see your Angular application in the browser. Use the following command:

   ```bash
   ng serve
   ```

   By default, the application will be accessible at `http://localhost:4200/`.

6. **Explore the Generated Project**:
   The Angular CLI generates a complete project structure with sample components, modules, and configuration files. You can start building your Angular application by modifying these generated files.

7. **Create Components, Services, and More**:
   You can use the Angular CLI to generate various parts of your application, such as components, services, modules, and more. For example, to create a new component, use the following command:

   ```bash
   ng generate component my-component
   ```

8. **Build for Production**:
   When you're ready to deploy your application, you can build a production-ready bundle using the following command:

   ```bash
   ng build --prod
   ```

   This will create optimized files in the `dist/` directory.
